<p>I am a self motivated ,   quick learner  and have a lot of patience.
  I am a little introvert but to improve in that field 
  when i was having tea at sabzi mandi in evening  
  i saw a children reading out headlines from a newspaper 
  they picked from a dustbin along with empty bottles .
  I disscussed this with my friend before lockdown and we 
  started a small group on our own named " Innocent Dream Foundation "
  with some of my college friends to provide study materials 
  to childrens living in slums with our monthly  savings and 
  encourage their parents for their children's education .
  In that small group i was  responsible for the management and planning
  of our visits , informing and handling the information about each member
  of our group   . i  get to interact with childrens and their families and try my level best to ensure that they became aware of the importance of education  .
  It helped me a lot in improving my interaction skills .
